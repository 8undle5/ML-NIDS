Safeguarding the confidentiality of any network for example, an organization network structure from an attack and make sure the privacy of all users, network administrator is protected. A machine learning intrusion detection models were developed utilising the random forest, Naïve Bayes, K nearest neighbours and decision trees algorithms. The recursive feature importance measure was applied to obtain the most important features for selection to the machine learning algorithms. Thereafter, the models were optimized with different techniques such as Random Search, Grid Search and TPOT to achieve a higher detection overall accuracy and examine how every parameter affects the models. It was observed that the TPOT automated genetic algorithm has generated the best optimised pipeline with the highest average score for all the models. The lowest accuracy result for binary classification was from the Naïve Bayes algorithm (91.23%), followed by Decision Tree (98.86%) and KNN (98.96%). The highest result was from the Random Forest achieving 99.44% for binary classification.
mitigate it.
The project was implemented in a virtual environment. The following tools were utilized to compelete the project:
- NSL-KDD,
- Virtual NIDS Lab and Open-Source IDS tools
- Fedora machine, Linux.
- Kali Linux VM Snort, Suricata.
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda).
- Python 3.
- Scikit-Learn
